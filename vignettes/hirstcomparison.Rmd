# Load Data

```{r}

# The data was provided by Fiona Tummon, in form of 10-minute pollen counts.
# The data prep until that point was not re-evaluated.
# The datetimes were provided in a seperate file (tbd whether those are UTC or not)
# PAY2, PAY4 and PAY8 are three different pollen traps
# lines 2,4,6,7 are four different lines, along which the pollen were manually counted under the microsope.
# Lines 2 and 6 were counted in 2013, whereas lines 4 and 7 were counted in 2019

path_data <- paste0(here::here(), "/ext-data/")
files_data <- list.files(path_data, pattern = "2013_10min.csv")

dates_raw <-
  map(files_datetimes,~ read_delim(
    paste0(path_data, .x),
    delim = ";",
    col_names = FALSE,
    col_types = cols(.default = "n") # dates and times are in a weird format, have to import as numeric as a consequence
    )
  ) %>%

dates <- map(dates_raw, ~mutate(
  .x,
  time = sprintf("%04d", as.integer(X2)), # otherwise we lose leading zeros
  datetime = ymd_hm(paste0(X1, time)))%>% 
    select(datetime)
  )

# Combining the measurements with the datetimes for the three traps
# It appears that the traps have slightly different timestamps
data <- map2(data_raw, rep(1:3, each = 4), ~bind_cols(.x, dates[[.y]]) %>% mutate(trap = 2^(.y)))

# Create a new variable to differentiate between counted lines; note that traps were already defined in the previous map-call above
data <- map2(data, rep(c(2, 4, 6, 7), 3), ~mutate(.x, line = .y))

# We are only interested on a subset of the data
# The order of variables is different in the PAY2 and PAY6 data, those are the old counts from 2013

data = map(data, ~select(.x, 
    kacastz0, kaalnuz0, kaulmuz0, kacuprz0, kafraxz0, kafaguz0, kajuglz0, khplanz0, kacoryz0,

  setNames(c(
    "Castanea", "Alnus", "Ulmus", "Cupress", "Fraxinus", "Fagus", "Juglans", "Plantago", "Corylus", 
    "Pinus", "Quercus", "Rumex", "Platanus", "Populus", "Poaceae", "Salix", "Betula", "Carpinus", 
    "UrticacÃ©es", "Taxus", "Picea", "datetime")))

# map(dates, ~summary(.x))
# map(data_raw, ~summary(.x))

```

There are a few missing measurements, we will impute/exclude those in the next step.

```{r}

```

Now let's plot some time series to get a better overview of the data.
For better visibility I am displaying hourly sums as a minimum timespan.

```{r}

data[[1]] %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Alnus))


```
